# Sentry 2.0

Sentry 2.0 adds new features like ACL (permissions) to the already simple, easy to use authorization and authentication package built for FuelPHP.

##Features

* Authentication (via username or email)
* Authorization
* Groups
* ACL (Permissions)
	- Group Level or custom per user
* Remember Me
* User Suspension / Login Attempt Limiter
* Password Reset
* User Activation
* User Metadata

##Removed From v1.1
Before migrating to Sentry 2.0, please take note of the following features that have been removed and/or changed.

* Nested Groups are no longer supported
* is_admin for groups are no longer supported
* Group levels are no longer supported.

**Running the migration file will remove the support for the features above. Make sure you test this before running on a production server.**

##Added In 2.0
Get excited! Sentry 2.0 introduces ACL into the mix. Super simple to understand and implement.  We've tried to keep this as simple and quick as possible.

##Downloading Sentry 2.0
You can download Sentry 2.0 into your FuelPHP's packages directory. You can download the latest version of Sentry via [zip here](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/tree/2.0/develop) or pull directly from the repository with the following command within the 'fuel/packages/' directory.

	$ git clone -b 2.0/develop git@github.com:cartalyst/sentry.git sentry

##Installing Sentry 2.0
Once downloaded, you may want to add sentry to the always load packages array in 'app/config.php'. Installing the tables is as simple as running an oil migration.

**Note:** *Your database must be setup first!*

From your command line run:

	$ php oil r migrate --packages=sentry

##What Next?
This is just a guide to get you started. Once Sentry 2.0 reaches final release we will have full documentation for you. Below we will describe how to use the new features in Sentry 2.0.
For features that are not 2.0 specific, please go see the [Sentry 1.1 Manual](http://sentry.cartalyst.com/manual/v1.1.html). Please note the features above that are no longer available.
